Modify MPU APIs to:
- New API to register a region , and returning a region Id (0 .. 31)
- Components register a region(or regions) in their boot-time initalization
  function (function invoked before threads are created)
- Each thread has a region mask, which contains one bit per region.
- Add region, adds the region to the calling thread if not already added
  to the thread, sets the corresponding bit in the region mask and returns
  the previous region mask
- Remove a region removes the region and turns off the corresponding
  bit in the region mask
- Interface functions of components are supposed to add the component's
  region(s) on etry and remove the componet region(s) on exit, but only
  if the region was actually added on entry (not if the reion was already
  there)
